# Introduction

FuncyStr (pronounced "Funky string") is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to process strings with embedded functions. It allows dynamic string resolution based on provided parameters, supporting nested and multiple function calls within a single string. 

The library was inspired by [MediaWiki's internationalization system](https://github.com/wikimedia/banana-i18n?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Features

- **Dynamic String Resolution**: Replace placeholders in strings with dynamic values based on provided parameters.
- **Custom Functions**: Define your own functions to handle specific placeholders.
- **Nested Functions**: Supports resolving functions within other functions.
- **Graceful Handling**: Leaves unresolved placeholders intact if no matching function is defined.
